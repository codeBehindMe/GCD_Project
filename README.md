# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

### About
This Readme file is a guide to the script (run_analysis.R) generated to complete the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data (Data Science Specialization) offered by John Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health through Coursera. 
The data set for this project is sourced through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

The data set is :

"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"  Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013.

You may find the dataset at :http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

It is strongly recommended that you read the Readme.txt found with the original dataset prior to utilizing run_analysis.R

There are three component's to the script;
1. The script itself (what it does)
2. tidydata.txt file
3. codebook.md file

### run_analysis.R
This script is generated to meet the requirements set out by the Course project. In summary they are;

1. Merge training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Generates a second independant tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
